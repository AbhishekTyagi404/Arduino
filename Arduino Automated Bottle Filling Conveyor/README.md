The project consists of a belt conveyor, for filling of bottles to a required level of liquid (height), a few sensors to take input, a controller to control actuations and some actuators to fulfill the overall task. 
The inputs to the system will be a pre-set (controllable) liquid level required. The sensors will detect the presence of a bottle under filling station and the instantaneous amount of liquid level reached while filling. The controller controls the conveyor movement and the actuator to start and stop filling. This project can be used as a simulator for automatic filling stations in beverages, pharmaceutical and dairy process industries. 
The objective of this project is to create an automated filling station for cans / bottles, using detection technique for bottles and controlled level filling.
